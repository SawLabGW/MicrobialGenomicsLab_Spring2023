The reason for that is Illumina sequences that produced these files is usually run to sequence two ends of a single DNA fragment and for each DNA fragment that was sequenced, you have two sequences that you know are physically linked and therefore we call them **\"read pairs\"**. Pairing information is very useful for genome assembly and mapping. We will come to that in later labs.\n",

This makes it difficult to confidently assign correct letters of DNA towards the end and the instrument records lower read qualities near the end.\n",
