While Blackboard works fine, due to the cross-listed nature of the course, sometimes it becomes very difficult to organize content across both courses on Blackboard. We will use Blackboard for grading and submission of assignments but for sharing of content and classroom communications, we will use Slack.\n",

However, we can decide to make it private by only offering the contents through a private Github repository. "
